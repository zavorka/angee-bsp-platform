= Angee BSP metarepository

To get the BSP you need to have `repo` installed and use it as:

Install the `repo` utility if not present already:

[source,console]
$: curl http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/git-repo-downloads/repo > /usr/local/bin/repo
$: chmod a+x /usr/local/bin/repo

Download the BSP source:

[source,console]
$: mkdir angee-bsp
$: cd angee-bsp
$: repo init -u git@gitlab.meetangee.com/devops/angee-bsp-platform -b master
$: repo sync

At the end of the commands you have every metadata you need to start work with.

To start a simple image build:

[source,console]
$: source ./setup-environment build
$: bitbake core-image-minimal

You can use any directory to host your build.

The source code is checked out at `angee-bsp/sources`.
